    "3. Does it influence the acceptance rate of our landlords, i.e. the percentage of bookings accepted?\n",

    "\n",
    "Solely by acceptance_at, we can say that the new feature have a strong positive influence, increasing from 29% to 99%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Does it influence the payment rate of our students, i.e. the percentage of bookings paid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is important to say that according to my interpretation and understading of all features and consequent data, \n",
    "I decided to use paid_at to answer this question, instead of using current_state and its states (e.g. 'paid').\n",
    "This being said, in order to analyse the new feature influence in booking's payment rate, let's use paid_at.\n",

    "WHERE paid_at IS NOT NULL AND new_move_in_at IS NOT NULL;\n",
    "R: 51\n",
    "\n",
    "51 paid bookings out of 325 new_move_in_at not null cases (~16%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this feature, we can see a positive influence in the payment rate of bookings by students.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What more data would you require to evaluate the feature and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaching this problem without prior knowledge, could be useful to have a detailed definition of what each feature mean and how each feature interacts with one another, \n",
    "as there were some doubts related to what each state meant in current_state and how exactly they were related with other features.\n",
    "For example in question 3, to calculate the acceptance rate of our landlords could we assume\n",
    "the states \"paid\" and \"confirmed\" to be included as part of the percentage accepted? \n",
    "\n",
    "Would be interesting to extend, over time, the use of this feature to gather more data, since its a relatively recent (less than a year).\n",
    "Some suggestions could be made regarding booking time intervals (as seen in question 2) and then see the \"acceptance rate\" of those predefined suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2\n",
    "1. What are your main conclusions regarding the results of the feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing each figure, one can say that:\n",
    "- There's an increase of booking requests since the beginning of the test;\n",
    "- With price adjustments, this feature created interest in published offers that got no booking requests until then (overpriced offers);\n",
    "- Despite the increase in booking requests, the majority of offers (more than 500) still have no booking requests;\n",
    "- Offers that suffered a price decrease in the interval of 0 to 100 got more booking requests, although also being the majority of total offers. In cases were the decrease was of 100, the demand even surpassed the supply. \n",
    "The fact that offers with higher price decreases didn't had many requests might be related to landlord's high evaluation of its offer. Even with a greater price adjustment it is still not suitable for most people looking for an appartment/room/bed. \n",
    "- Seeing the price decrease percent figure its clear that price adjustments are made accordingly to each offer's price. A price decrease of 20% is predominant although it may not have the greatest success ratio (total requests / total offers).\n",
    "- After July 2017 there was an significant decrease on the average click position, which might mean that clients found a more interesting offer much faster than before. Top search offers became more relevant over time (lower average click position).\n",
    "- Similarly, we can conclude that top search results became/are more relevant (more total clicks).\n",
    "- Since the implementation of this feature (August 2017), offers with price recommendation became more interesting to students and had more total clicks (massive increase). In the other hand, this increase could also be correlated with searches prior to the beginning of a new semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What other data would you need to evaluate the feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to analyse the acceptance rates by landlords regarding booking requests with new prices. Especially in cases of booking rejection, gather information regarding price reduction flexibility. In general, although knowing that this feature created a positive impact in \"obsolete\" offers, see how much of this new interest resulted in success cases (booked offers).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can you design an experiment leading to more conclusive results? If so, please describe it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate results by offer type, analyse price considering offer's characteristics and location (e.g. proximity to university, near public transports, average and variance price values of the area in which the offer is located), gathering average and variance of prices for each offer type.\n",
    "Making a similar analysis, we can create a classification method (e.g. Decision Tree), training our data to return a price evaluation interval (e.g. 0 - 'cheap', 1 - 'normal', 2 - 'expensive', set according to average and variance price values) considering all relevant features and historic data. \n",
    "Thus, not booked offers, for a certain time threshold (defined by Data Analytics team), with similar characteristics could have a new price suggestion (adequate price per offer) taking into account similar booked offers, therefore reducing price discrepancies between \"real price\" and landlord set overprice. \n",
    "Then we could analyse the interest created in those offers by amount of clicks and booking rates, considering rates of \"normal\" offers and \"adapted\" offers."
