    "4. Does it influence the payment rate of our students, i.e. the percentage of bookings paid?\n",

    "\n",
    "5. What more data would you require to evaluate the feature and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaching this problem without prior knowledge, could be useful to have a detailed definition of what each feature mean and how each feature interacts with one another, as there were some doubts related to what each state meant in current_state and how exactly they were related with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be interesting to extend, over time, the use of this feature to gather more data, since its a relatively recent (deployed in July 3rd).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2\n",
    "1. What are your main conclusions regarding the results of the feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing each figure, one can say that:\n",
    "- There's an increase of booking requests since the beginning of the test;\n",
    "- With price adjustments, this feature created interest in published offers that got no booking requests until then (overpriced offers);\n",
    "- Despite the increase in booking requests, the majority of offers (more than 500) still have no booking requests;\n",
    "- Offers that suffered a price decrease in the interval of 0 to 100 got more booking requests, although also being the majority of total offers. In cases were the decrease was of 100, the demand even surpassed the supply. \n",
    "The fact that offers with higher price decreases didn't had many requests might be related to landlord's high evaluation of its offer. Even with a greater price adjustment it is still not suitable for most people looking for an appartment/room/bed. \n",
    "- By \"price decrease percent\" figure its clear that price adjustments are made accordingly to each offer's price. A price decrease of 20% is predominant although it may not have the greatest success ratio (total requests / total offers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Considering \"Average click position on search for offers with price recommendation\", after July 2017 there was an significant decrease on the average click position per day, which might mean that students found a more interesting offer ranked higher (between 1 and 25). Offers ranked higher as search result, i.e. with lower average click position, became more relevant since July 2017 and maintained the trend during the test, due to a good price recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysing \"Total clicks by search position on offers with price recommendation\", better ranked search results (first 20 results) are more relevant than the rest, gathering most of the clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From \"Total clicks per day on offers with price recommendation\" we can see see that since the implementation of the feature in 9th of August 2017, offers with price recommendation became more interesting to students and had a great increase in total clicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing and assessing this test, we can say that price recommendations set by the algorithm in obsolete and \"overlooked\" offers have a positive influence in creating interest and booking requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What other data would you need to evaluate the feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to analyse the acceptance rates by landlords regarding booking requests with new prices. Especially in cases of booking rejection, gather information regarding price reduction flexibility. In general, although knowing that this feature created a positive impact in \"obsolete\" offers, see how much of this new interest resulted in success cases (booked offers).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Can you design an experiment leading to more conclusive results? If so, please describe it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can separate results by offer type, analyse price considering offer's characteristics and location (e.g. proximity to university, near public transports, average and variance price values of the area in which the offer is located), gathering average and variance of prices for each offer type. This approach, although may not improve current results, could give a more detailed picture to each offer type and, eventually, help tuning the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a fairly recent test, it would be good extend this trial at least a couple of months in order to get a more detailed analysis. The following months (after August) will bring more students to the platform, which may lead to an increase of booking requests in offers with price recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach would be, considering not booked offers, with similar characteristics and for a certain time threshold (defined by Data Analytics team), could have a new price suggestion (adequate price per offer) taking into account similar booked offers, therefore reducing price discrepancies between \"real price\" and landlord set overprice. Similar offers can be offers with a certain \"membership degree\" (high membership degree, with a threshold not too far from 1 if range between 0 and 1) regarding other offers, considering characteristics such as if is property (how many bedrooms), bedroom or bed, its location (e.g. near a specific university, in a particular neighbourhood), etc. Then we could analyse the interest created in those offers by amount of clicks and booking rates, considering rates of \"normal\" offers and \"adapted\" offers.\n"
